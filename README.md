# TailwindCSS Enhanced Blog Post Editor

## Introduction
This project showcases my expertise in **web development** using **PHP** and **TailwindCSS**. I have created a clean and responsive blog post editor and viewer, styled with TailwindCSS, that demonstrates my ability to combine backend logic with modern frontend design. The goal is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for both viewing and editing blog posts.

## Features
- **Dynamic Blog Post Viewer**: Users can view blog posts dynamically, each with a well-designed structure using TailwindCSS.
- **Edit and Delete Functionalities**: Logged-in users can easily edit or delete any post, making the platform highly interactive.
- **Responsive Design**: The entire layout is responsive, ensuring a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User Authentication**: The system checks if the user is logged in, and only authenticated users can edit or delete posts.

## Form Design
The **edit form** allows users to:
1. **Edit the blog title** with validation.
2. **Edit the description** using a large textarea.
3. **Update the publish date** with a date picker.
4. **Save changes** with a stylish and accessible button.

All form elements are designed with **TailwindCSS** to ensure a clean, modern, and responsive interface. The use of **focus effects**, **rounded corners**, and **hover states** makes the form visually appealing and easy to use.

## Technologies Used
- **PHP**: For backend logic, handling sessions, and form processing.
- **TailwindCSS**: For designing the frontend with minimal code and maximum flexibility.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the form and content.
